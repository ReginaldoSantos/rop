# This Is a Fork of Rop

(Under Construction)

This is a Fork of Rop lib aiming to include discoverable or pluggable '@Command' implementations, so sub commands could be added on the fly just being available in the classpath.

Check original project (here)[https://github.com/ryenus/rop]

## Initial IDEA

Do something similar to spring-shell using component scan to load the commands.
